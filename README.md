This release is wholly different from GeoCoin 1.0 and 2.0.

It includes the following refinements:

New block chain.

New Graphics! Program updated with Caching themed icons and lingo.

Built-in Coin Creation System Improvements (Virtual Caching) 

QR Code Support

One-click Access to Command Line Console

Another thing you may notice is the decimals are gone--but really
that's just trickery. They are still there, but only viewable using
the Command Line Console for easy math, so values may go up or down
by a coin or two in your Collected balance.

GeoCoin has its own Block Explorer at: https://andarazoroflove.org/explorer/geocoin

GeoCoin is Free and Open Source and should not be
considered "currency." GeoCoin is designed to be easy
to create with a CPU using a built in "mining" function.
