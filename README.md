GeoCoin 2.0

Simple cryptographic tokens for sharing and trading!

This release is wholly different from GeoCoin 1.0.
It includes the following refinements:

*33 Coins Per Block, forever and ever
*1 Billion Max Coins
*140 Character Transaction Messaging

Defaults:

*RPC PORT 3870
*P2P PORT 3871
*TESTNET PORT 13871
*%appdata%/geocoin.conf
*addnode=andarazoroflove.org

GeoCoin is Free and Open Source and should not be
considered "currency." GeoCoin is designed to be easy
to create with a CPU using a built in "mining" function.
